# 🧠 SQL Basic Project -- Retail & Business Database Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates core **SQL skills** through the design and
manipulation of a structured relational database.\
The database models a simplified **retail business environment**,
including entities such as employees, products, customers, orders, and
transactions.

The goal of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency across **data
creation, retrieval, aggregation, update, and deletion** operations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🗂️ Database Structure

The project includes **five main tables**:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Table Name                             Description
  -------------------------------------- --------------------------------
  **employees**                          Stores details about company
                                         employees, departments,
                                         salaries, and hire dates.

  **products**                           Contains product inventory
                                         information including category,
                                         price, and stock quantity.

  **customers**                          Records customer details such as
                                         name, email, phone, and city.

  **orders**                             Tracks customer purchases with
                                         product references and order
                                         dates.

  **transaction**                        Logs financial transactions with
                                         payment methods and transaction
                                         amounts.

## 🧩 Key Features

### 1. **Data Definition (DDL)**

-   Creation of multiple interrelated tables.
-   Implementation of primary key constraints.
-   Proper data types for business-relevant fields.

### 2. **Data Manipulation (DML)**

-   **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** operations across all tables.
-   Realistic sample data for employees, products, customers, and
    transactions.

### 3. **Analytical SQL Queries**

Includes queries that solve real-world business problems, such as: -
Finding employees with the highest or lowest salary. - Calculating total
stock value per product category. - Counting customers by city. -
Finding total number of orders per date. - Calculating average
transaction amount by payment method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Example Queries

Here are a few examples of the queries included in the project:

### 🔹 Highest Salary Employee

``` sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

### 🔹 Total Product Stock Value by Category

``` sql
SELECT category, SUM(price * quantity_in_stock) AS total_stock_value
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

### 🔹 Average Transaction by Payment Method

``` sql
SELECT payment_method, ROUND(AVG(amount), 2) AS avg_amt
FROM transaction
GROUP BY payment_method;
```
